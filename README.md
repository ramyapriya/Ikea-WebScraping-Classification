# Ikea-WebScraping-Classification

A repository to perform data collection of images using web scraping techniques to create a dataset from the IKEA website. The datatset created is then used to build a deep learning model which uses a convolutional neural network based image classifier implemented in keras to classify images into 4 categories - beds, tables, chairs and tableware.

The model successfully achieved an accuracy of about 92% on the training set and 85% on the test set.
